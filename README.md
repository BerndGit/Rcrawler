# Rcrawler: A web crawler and scraper using R

Rcrawler is an R package for web crawling web sites and extracting structured data which can be used for a wide range of useful applications, like data mining, information processing or historical archival.
## RCrawler main features  

## Installation 
First make sure to verify Java 64-bit is installed on your computer. Preferably, install both 32-bit and 64-bit .   
```
#check java version
system("java -version")
```
Install the release version from CRAN:
```
install.packages("Rcrawler")
```
*If you got this error: No CurrentVersion entry in Software/JavaSoft registry! Try re-installing Java and make sure R and Java have matching architectures. Then use :*
```
install.packages("Rcrawler", INSTALL_opts = "--no-multiarch")
```
Or the development version from github:
```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("salimk/Rcrawler")
```
## How to use Rcrawler
In order to show you what Rcrawler brings to the table, weâ€™ll walk you through some use case examples:
Start by loading the library
```
library(Rcrawler)
```

###### 1- Collecting web pages from a website
```
Rcrawler(Website = "http://www.glofile.com", no_cores = 4, no_conn = 4)
```
This command allows downloading all HTML files of a website from the server to your computer. It can be useful if you want to do analysis on the whole web page (HTML file). Also, if you want to use a specific data extraction technique on collected web pages.

At the end of crawling process this function will return :

- A variable named "INDEX" in your global environment: It's a data frame representing the generic URL index, which includes all crawled/scraped web pages with their details (content type, HTTP state, the number of out-links and in-links, encoding type, and level). 
![INDEX variable](http://imgh.us/INDEX_34.png)
- A directory named as the website's domain, in this case, "glofile.com" it's by default located in your working directory (R workspace). This directory contains all crawled and downloaded web pages (.html files). Files are named with the same numeric "id" they have in INDEX.

NOTE: Make sure that the website you want to crawl is not so big, as it may take more computer resources and time to finish. Stay polite, avoid overloading the server, the chance to get banned from the host server is bigger when you use many parallel connections. 

###### 2- Filtering collected/parsed Urls by Regular expression
As you know a Web page might be a category page (list of elements,) or a detail page (like product/article page). For some reason, you may want to collect just the detail pages or you may want to collect just pages in a particular website section. In this case, you need to use Regular expressions as it's shown below:
```
Rcrawler(Website = "http://www.glofile.com", no_cores = 4, no_conn = 4, urlregexfilter ="/[0-9]{4}/[0-9]{2}/" )
```
This command collect all URLs matching this regular expression "/[0-9]{4}/[0-9]{2}/[0-9]{2}/". Ulrs having 4-digit/2-digit/2-digit/, which are blog post pages in our example .
