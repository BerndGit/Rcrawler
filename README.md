# An R web crawler and scraper 

Rcrawler is an R package for web crawling websites and extracting structured data which can be used for a wide range of useful applications, like data mining, information processing or historical archival.
## RCrawler main features  

## Installation 

Install the release version from CRAN:
```
install.packages("Rcrawler")
```
Or the development version from GitHub:
```
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("salimk/Rcrawler")
```
## How to use Rcrawler
To show you what Rcrawler brings to the table, weâ€™ll walk you through some use case examples:
Start by loading the library
```
library(Rcrawler)
```

###### 1- Collecting web pages from a website
```
Rcrawler(Website = "http://www.glofile.com", no_cores = 4, no_conn = 4)
```
This command allows downloading all HTML files of a website from the server to your computer. It can be useful if you want to analyze or apply something on the whole web page (HTML file). 

At the end of crawling process this function will return :

- A variable named "INDEX" in the global environment: It's a data frame representing the general URL index, which includes all crawled/scraped web pages with their details (content type, HTTP state, the number of out-links and in-links, encoding type, and level). 
![INDEX variable](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17308124/31500701-0a153c9c-af60-11e7-85ea-15d40f7fe6cf.PNG)
- A directory named as the website's domain, in this case, "glofile.com" it's by default located in your working directory (R workspace). This directory contains all crawled and downloaded web pages (.html files). Files are named with the same numeric "id" they have in INDEX.
![File repository](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17308124/31500728-1ff15e6a-af60-11e7-89c9-b1aa1c4448eb.PNG)

NOTE: Make sure that the website you want to crawl is not so big, as it may take more computer resources and time to finish. Stay polite, avoid overloading the server, the chance to get banned from the host server is bigger when you use many parallel connections. 

###### 2- Filtering collected/parsed Urls by Regular expression
As you know a Web page might be a category page (list of elements,) or a detail page (like product/article page). For some reason, you may want to collect just the detail pages or you may want to collect just pages in a particular website section. In this case, you need to use Regular expressions as it's shown below:
```
Rcrawler(Website = "http://www.glofile.com", no_cores = 4, no_conn = 4, urlregexfilter ="/[0-9]{4}/[0-9]{2}/[0-9]{2}/" )
```
This command collect all URLs matching this regular expression "/[0-9]{4}/[0-9]{2}/[0-9]{2}/". Ulrs having 4-digit/2-digit/2-digit/, which are blog post pages in our example .
```
 http://www.glofile.com/2017/06/08/sondage-quel-budget-prevoyez-vous
 http://www.glofile.com/2017/06/08/jcdecaux-reconduction-dun-cont
 http://www.glofile.com/2017/06/08/taux-nette-detente-en-italie-bc
```

```
Rcrawler(Website = "http://www.glofile.com/sport", urlregexfilter ="/sport/" )
```
This command crawl the whole website and collect only pages of section "sport" in url.

**Note:** filtering URLs by a Regular expression, means the crawler will parse content (collect page) only from these specific URLs, It does not mean limiting the crawling process to only those particular URLs. In fact, if a website has 1000 links and just 200 matching the given regex, the crawler still need to crawl all 1000 link to find out these 200. if you want to limit the crawling process you can use MaxDepth parameter (refer to 5th section in this presentation)

###### 3-Scrape data while crawling a website
In the example below , we will try to extract articles and titles from our demo blog. To do this we need to filter out blog post pages (see 2), also we need to specify xpath pattern of elements to extract.  
```
Rcrawler(Website = "http://www.glofile.com", no_cores = 4, no_conn = 4, urlregexfilter ="/[0-9]{4}/[0-9]{2}/[0-9]{2}/", ExtractPatterns = c("//h1","//article"))
```
As result this function will return in addition to "INDEX" variable and file repository :
- A variable named "DATA" in global environment: It's a list of extracted contents. 
![DATA and INDEX variable](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17308124/31500758-3532af40-af60-11e7-9fed-0aab2eb0ff5b.PNG)

**Note :** before using ExtractPatterns on RCrawler function, try first to test your Xpath patterns on a single webage to ensure that they are correct using :
```
pageinfo<-LinkExtractor("http://glofile.com/index.php/2017/06/08/athletisme-m-a-rome/")
Data<-ContentScraper(pageinfo[[1]][[10]],c("//head/title","//*/article"))
```
Then check Data variable it should handle the extracted data, if it contain "NA", it means there are no data on the page matching the given xpath. 

###### 4-Filter collected/ scraped web page by search terms/keywords
If you want to crawl a website and collect/scrape only some web pages related to a specific topic, Rcrawler function has two useful parameters KeywordsFilter and KeywordsAccuracy

KeywordsFilter: a character vector, here you should provide keywords/terms of the topic you are looking. Rcrawler will calculate an accuracy score based matched keywords and their occurrence on the page, then by default, it collects or scrapes only web pages with at least a score of 1% wich mean at least one keyword is founded one time on the page. This parameter must be a vector with at least one keyword like c("mykeyword").

KeywordsAccuracy. Integer value range between 0 and 100, used only with the KeywordsFilter parameter to determine the accuracy of web pages to collect. You can use one or more search terms; the accuracy will be calculated based on how many provided keywords exist on the page plus their occurrence rate. For example, if only one keyword is provided c("keyword") so ,
50% means one occurrence of "keyword" in the page
100% means five occurrences of "keyword" in the page 

```
Rcrawler(Website = "http://www.example.com/", KeywordsFilter = c("keyword1", "keyword2"))`
```
Crawl the website and collect only webpages containing keyword1 or keyword2 or both.

```
Rcrawler(Website = "http://www.example.com/", KeywordsFilter = c("keyword1", "keyword2"), KeywordsAccuracy = 50)
```
Crawl the website and collect only webpages that has an accuracy percentage higher than 50%
of matching keyword1 and keyword2.

###### 5-Liming the crawling process to a level
Some popular websites are too big, and you don't have time or don't want to crawl the whole website for a specific reason, or sometimes you may just need to crawl the top links in the specific web page. For this purpose, you could use Maxdepth parameter to limit the crawler from going so deep. 
```
Rcrawler(Website="http://101greatgoals.com/betting/" ,MaxDepth=1)
```
This command will parse only pages related to this link http://101greatgoals.com/betting/ (only links on that page will be crawled)

```
Rcrawler(Website="http://101greatgoals.com/betting/" ,MaxDepth=4, urlregexfilter = "/betting/")
```
In this example the crawler start from this http://101greatgoals.com/betting/ and continue crawling until it reach the 4th level , however it will only collect pages of "betting" section ( having /betting/ in their url)

###### Other Examples
Other example : 
```
Rcrawler(Website = "http://www.master-maroc.com", KeywordsFilter = c("casablanca", "master"), KeywordsAccuracy = 50, ExtractPatterns = c("//*[@class='article-content']","//*[@class='contentheading clearfix']"))
```
This command will crawl  http://www.master-maroc.com website and look for pages containing  keywords "casablanca" or "master", then data matching given Xpaths patterns are extracted .
